/// @brief	NMEA protocol parser
///
/// This is a lightweight NMEA parser, derived originally from the
/// TinyGPS parser by Mikal Hart.  It is frugal in its use of memory
/// and tries to avoid unnecessary arithmetic.
///
/// The parser handles GPGGA, GPRMC and GPVTG messages, and attempts to be
/// robust in the face of occasional corruption in the input stream.  It
/// makes a basic effort to configure GPS' that are likely to be connected in
/// NMEA mode (SiRF, MediaTek and ublox) to emit the correct message
/// stream, but does not validate that the correct stream is being received.
/// In particular, a unit emitting just GPRMC will show as having a fix
/// even though no altitude data is being received.
///
/// GPVTG data is parsed, but as the message may not contain the the
/// qualifier field (this is common with e.g. older SiRF units) it is
/// not considered a source of fix-valid information.
///
